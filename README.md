:point_right: Architecture:
-----------------

- Following Clean Architecture.
- MVVM Architecture.
- Repository pattern.
- Use Cases.
- Applying SOLID principles, each class has a single job with separation of concerns by making classes independent

- Using Kotlin-KTS & buildSrc to handle project dependencies.

:point_right: Tech Stack & Libraries:
-----------------

- Navigation component - navigation graph for navigating and replacing screens/fragments
- DataBinding - allows to more easily write code that interacts with views and replaces ```findViewById```.
- ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
- Kotlin Coroutines - for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
- Retrofit2 & OkHttp3 - to make REST requests to the web service integrated.
